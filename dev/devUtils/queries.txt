Querying Mongo DB for recipes and ingredients. 

Using MongoDB's Query Structure, will be adjusted later for the DB Client. 


Data structures for ingredients:

    {
        _id: Object ID created by MongoDB
        "id": number - unique ID for DB (starts at 1),
        "Name": string - Name of the ingredient (Golden Apple, Chillshroom, etc),
        "Type": string - category of ingredients (Fruit, Vegetable, etc),
        "Effect": string - effect of the ingredient or dish when used (Heat Resistance, Shock Resistance, etc),
        "Prefix": string - the prefix added to the recipe name when effect is used,
        "sellPrice": "8",
        "buyPrice": "32",
        "locations": [
            "Near Sonapan Shrine",
            "Hyrule Field"
        ]
    },



-- Recipes ------------------------------------------

Finding recipes with only the specified ingredients (Recipes that do not require any more ingredients to make)


**** working on this ****


--------

Finding recipes with any of the specified ingredients



[
{
"$match": {
    "$or": [
    { "ingredients.name": { "$in": ["Golden Apple", "Goat Butter", "Hylian Rice"] } },
    { "ingredients.options": { "$in": ["Golden Apple", "Goat Butter", "Hylian Rice"] } },
    { "ingredients.type": { "$in": ["Fruit", "Special", "Special"] } }
    ]
}
}
]



Note that this will give recipes with the ingredients included, but will feature recipes the user may not 
have all of the ingredients for. 


--------

Finding recipes with all of the specified ingredients:

The $and operator means it must match all of the things listed below. The $or means one of the options listed. 
The $or is used to account for recipes that list the ingredient by name as a neccesary ingredient, accept 
the ingedient as one of many as one ingredient, or accept any of the ingredient type as one ingredient.



{
  "$and": [
    {
      "$or": [
        { "ingredients.name": { "$in": ["Golden Apple", "Goat Butter", "Hylian Rice"] } },
        { "ingredients.options": { "$in": ["Golden Apple", "Goat Butter", "Hylian Rice"] } },
        { "ingredients.type": { "$in": ["Fruit", "Special", "Special"] } }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
